Done with:
 - Channels parsing - Jaspur
 - type="bitorus" - Rasmus
 - Draw schedule as cartoon - Mark
 - type "all2all" - Rasmus
 - Greedy initial schedule - Mark
 - Command line arguments - Jaspur
 
To do:
  - Operators (Route, delete, reroute, replace)
  - Bandwidth to channels
  - Link local
  - Metaheuristics, SA ALNS GRASP
  - Delta eval (vector over timeslots)
	- Gafle ud
  - Parallel behaviour
	- Neighbourhood
	- Several metaheuristics running seperately
	- 
  
  - Rapport
	- Teori: Algoritmer (SA, ALNS, etc)
	- Testing
	- Datastructure organization 
		- Delta eval
	- Schedule of route, use DFS rather than BFS
	- In grasp it only makes sense to rip up more than just the dominating path
