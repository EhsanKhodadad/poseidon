Done with:
 - Channels parsing - Jaspur
 - type="bitorus" - Rasmus
 - Draw schedule as cartoon - Mark
 
To do:
  - type "all2all"
  - Command line arguments
  - Greedy initial schedule
  - Metaheuristics, SA ALNS GRASP
  - Operators (Route, delete, reroute, replace)
	- SA: 
  - Delta eval (vector over timeslots)
	- Gafle ud
  - Parallel behaviour
	- Neighborhoob
	- Several metaheuristics running seperately
	- 
  
  - Rapport
	- Teori: Algoritmer (SA, ALNS, etc)
	- Testing
	- Datastructure organization 
		- Delta eval
	- Schedule of route, use DFS rather than BFS
	- In grasp it only makes sense to rip up more than just the dominating path
